                            <h4>Continuous Learning</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li> I am committed to both personal and professional growth because I believe in constantly enhancing my knowledge and skills through formal education, on-the-job experiences, or self-study. Staying up to date with modern techniques has enabled me to pivot and excel in various positions. For instance, meeting with various seasoned producers and mentors for their advice on decisions and scenarios has allowed me to define clear actionable strategies that have guided my team through complex challenges and achieve success.
                                </li>
                             </ul>   
                            <h4>Collaboration></h4>    
                                <li>I create a supportive and inclusive environment where every team member's voice is valued. By encouraging teamwork and mutual respect, I aim to achieve collective success. It is essential to share learnings, knowledge, and information to help each other grow and succeed in our careers. I regularly host team meetings to foster open communication and collaboration, sharing context, facilitating discussions, gathering feedback, and answering questions surrounding team goals, priorities, and upcoming forecasts. By fostering open communication and ensuring every team member is kept in the loop, I was able to boost our team health score from 35% to 75% within two quarters, significantly enhancing team morale and productivity.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Integrity</h4>    
                                <li>I uphold the highest standards of honesty and transparency in all my interactions. Trust is built by being present, engaging in personal interactions, and adhering to established values. I openly share my decision-making process and maintain transparent communication with all developers and stakeholders involved. This approach has fostered alignment, strengthened trust and collaboration, leading to more cohesive and successful project outcomes.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Innovation</h4>    
                                <li>I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of our capabilities. By embracing new technologies and creative solutions, I strive to bring fresh and effective ideas to every project I work on. This curiosity has led to the development and introduction of various workflows, automations, and tools that have greatly enhanced the developer experience. For example, I introduced an automation process that reduced content production time from days to less than two hours by optimizing Google Sheet formulas. This innovation has reduced toil and significantly improved efficiency.
                                </li>
